**Automation tools for companies that create business documents in Excel and Word—such as invoices, quotations, and purchase orders—and need to convert them to PDF and send them by email.**

We help small and medium‑sized businesses eliminate repetitive tasks, reduce errors, and complete document workflows in seconds.

## 1. One‑Click PDF Creation & Email Attachment

Our tool automatically converts your Word or Excel documents—such as invoices, quotations, purchase orders, and other business forms—into PDF files and attaches them to an email with a single click.

In many countries, including Japan, PDF documents are widely accepted as official business records. Fast and accurate PDF generation is essential for daily operations, and DASH Automation makes this process effortless.

### 2. No More Searching for Files

After creating a document, many companies spend unnecessary time saving it as a PDF, locating the file on their desktop or in multiple folders, and manually attaching it to an email.

DASH Automation eliminates all of these steps.

- The PDF is generated automatically
- The correct file is selected instantly
- No browsing through folders or searching for filenames
- No risk of attaching the wrong document

Your document is immediately ready to send, allowing you to focus on your actual work instead of file management.

### 3. Email Is Automatically Prepared

The software also prepares the email for you automatically.
Based on your predefined settings, it generates:

- The correct recipient
- A clear and consistent subject line
- An automatically generated email body based on your settings
- The PDF already attached

All you need to do is review the message and click **Send**.

This ensures fast, consistent communication and eliminates mistakes such as sending emails to the wrong recipient or forgetting attachments.
